How do you make a sandwich?
Making a sandwich is easy. 1. Start by gathering the ingredients you will need: bread, a spread such as mayonnaise, mustard, or butter, and fillings such as meats, cheeses, vegetables, and fruits. 2. Spread the desired spread over one side of the bread. 3. Place the desired filling on one slice of bread, and top with the other slice to form a sandwich. For a grilled sandwich, heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Place the sandwich in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the bread is golden brown. Flip the sandwich and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes. 4. Allow the sandwich to cool slightly before removing from the skillet and serving. Enjoy!
